          <p>THeseus <hi rend="italic">going over into </hi>Creet<hi rend="italic"> to fight with the</hi> Minotaure, <hi rend="italic">made his Father </hi>Ægeus<hi rend="italic"> this promise, that if he came off with Life and Victory, he would set up white sailes at his comming back, the Ship as he went out having black sailes in token of griefe: being come into </hi>Creet, Ariadne<hi rend="italic"> the Kings Daughter there fell in love with him, and gave him a Clew of thread, by which after he had slain the </hi>Minotaure<hi rend="italic"> he extricated himselfe out of that perplexed Labyrinth: having thus obtained the Victory he carryed her along with him into the Island </hi>Naxos,<hi rend="italic"> where he tooke occasion to leave her as she was a sleep, and so hasting homeward, forgot to hoist the white sails; his Father </hi>Ægeus,<hi rend="italic"> therefore, who stood upon a Rock, expecting his return, as soon as he percieved the black sailes, cast himselfe headlong into the Sea, from whom it was called the </hi>Ægean<hi rend="italic"> Sea. In this while, </hi>Ariadne<hi rend="italic"> complaining of </hi>Theseus<hi rend="italic"> his Infidelity, resolving to destroy her selfe, having made her own Epitaph, was comforted by </hi>Bacchus,<hi rend="italic"> who comming thither was enamoured of her Beauty, and took her to his protection.</hi></p>
